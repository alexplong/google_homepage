First project from The Odin Project is to deconstruct the Google Homepage and rebuild it. 

The goals of this project are to get familiar with how elements are placed on a page and how they are stylized and aligned for visually pleasing flow. 

By the end, I hope to be more comfortable and continue moving forward and working on more projects.
